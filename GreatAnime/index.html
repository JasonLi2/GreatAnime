              Having reached professional status in middle school, Rei Kiriyama is one of the few elite in the world of shogi. Due to this,
              he faces an enormous amount of pressure, both from the shogi community and his adoptive family. Seeking independence from his tense home life,
              he moves into an apartment in Tokyo. As a 17-year-old living on his own, Rei tends to take poor care of himself, and his reclusive personality
              ostracizes him from his peers in school and at the shogi hall.
            </p>
            <p class="description">
              However, not long after his arrival in Tokyo, Rei meets Akari, Hinata, and Momo Kawamoto, a trio of sisters living with their grandfather who owns a
              traditional wagashi shop. Akari, the oldest of the three girls, is determined to combat Rei's loneliness and poorly sustained lifestyle with motherly hospitality.
              The Kawamoto sisters, coping with past tragedies, also share with Rei a unique familial bond that he has lacked for most of his life.
              As he struggles to maintain himself physically and mentally through his shogi career, Rei must learn how to interact with others and understand his own complex emotions.

            <p class="description">
              Music accompanies the path of the human metronome, the prodigious pianist Kousei Arima. But after the passing of his mother,
              Saki Arima, Kousei falls into a downward spiral, rendering him unable to hear the sound of his own piano.
            </p>
            <p class="description">
              Two years later, Kousei still avoids the piano, leaving behind his admirers and rivals, and lives a colorless life alongside his friends Tsubaki Sawabe and Ryouta Watari.
               However, everything changes when he meets a beautiful violinist, Kaori Miyazono, who stirs up his world and sets him on a journey to face music again.
            </p>
            <p class="description">
              Based on the manga series of the same name, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso approaches the story of Kousei's recovery as he discovers that music is
               more than playing each note perfectly, and a single melody can bring in the fresh spring air of April.
